A simple tutorial: 8 steps to *Ruffus*
############################################################

***************************************

============
Features
============

The **Ruffus** provides automatic support for

        * Managing dependencies
        * Parallel jobs
        * Re-starting from arbitrary points, especially after errors
        * Display of the pipeline as a flowchart
        * Reporting


    | This tutorial has seven steps which cover all the core functionality of *Ruffus*.
    | Don't worry if steps 1 and 2 seem a bit slow: Once you get used to **Ruffus**
      steps 4-8 will be a breeze.

    You can click on "previous" and "next" at the top and bottom of each page to
    navigate through the tutorial.


============================
The first steps (1-4)
============================

    The first half of the tutorial will show you how to:

    1. Chain tasks (functions) together into a pipeline
    2. Provide parameters to run jobs in parallel
    3. Tracing through your new pipeline
    4. Using flowcharts

============================
A worked example (steps 5-8)
============================

    The second half of the tutorial is a worked example to calculate
    the sample variance of 10,000 random numbers. This shows you how to:

    5. Split up a large problem into smaller chunks
    6. Calculate partial solutions in parallel
    7. Re-combine the partial solutions into the final result
    8. Automatically signal the completion of each step of our pipeline


    This covers the core functionality of *Ruffus*.
